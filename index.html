      <h1>A Synopsis on the History of Mario</h1>
      <p>Super Mario (Aka JumpMan) first appeared in Donkey Kong (1981). This game featured Mario rescuing Pauline from the evil clutches of Donkey Kong by jumping over barrels and such. Mario's first big hit was in 1985, Super Mario Bros. Since then, Mario has become the "king" of nintendo. Lots Have happened since then, so someone decided to make a TV show about him. Thus, the Super Mario Brothers Super Show is born. It was amazing and you should totally check it out. It is my life. I love it so much that I had to make this website about it. Episode one is under the amazing picture and song links. Mario's common villan is Bowser, an evil koopa (basically a turtle) who is constantly trying to kidnap Princess Peach, ruler of the Mushroom Kingdom. Yet, Mario always defeats Bowser in an epic battle which usually ends in Bowser turning massive and Mario destroying his castle (with Bowser in it) every single time. you'd think Bowser would learn to maybe get rid of the giant button with an exlemation point on it, but noooo. it's just as well though, because if he wasn't stupid, Bowser would rule the Mushroom Kingdom and maybe the World. Mario has some other enemies too, like Cackletta, Fawful, Antasma, etc. In the show, the main enemy is Bowser again. He is constantly kidnapping Princess Peach in the show too. Because the show was made in 1989, the animation may be crude and disgusting to look at, but it is truely amazing and the plot is genius. If you are like this summary very much and want even more information on Mario, his games, and the history of him, look no further!
