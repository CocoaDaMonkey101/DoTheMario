      <h1>A Synopsis on the History of Mario</h1>
      <p>Super Mario (Aka JumpMan) first appeared in Donkey Kong (1981). This game featured Mario rescuing Pauline from the evil clutches of donkey kong by jumping over barrels and such. his first big hit was in 1985, Super Mario Bros. since then, mario has become the "king" of nintendo. lots has happened since then, so someone decided to make a TV show about him. Thus, the Super Mario Brothers Super Show is born. it was amazing and you should totally check it out. it is my life. i love it so much that i had to make this website about it. Episode one is under the amazing picture and song links. mario's common villan is bowser, an evil koopa (basically a turtle) who is constantly trying to kidnap princess peach, ruler of the mushroom kingdom. yet, mario has some other nemises' like cackletta, fawful, antasma, etc. in the show, the main enemy is bowser. he is constantly kidnapping princess peach. because the show was made in 1989, the animation may be horrible and disgusting to look at, but it is truely amazing and the plot is genius. please click on the links and watch the first episode. enjoy!!!</p>
