      <h1>A Short Synopsis on the History of Mario</h1>
      <p>Super Mario (Aka JumpMan) first appeared in Donkey Kong (1981). This game featured Mario rescuing Pauline from the evil clutches of donkey kong by jumping over barrels and such. his first big hit was in 1985, Super Mario Bros. since then, mario has become the "king" of nintendo. lots has happened since then, so someone decided to make a TV show about him. Thus, the Super Mario Brothers Super Show is born. it was amazin and you should check it out. is is my life. i love it so much that i had to make this website about it. here is the first episode, i hope you love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JA10XUaI3Mo"></p>
